# Acknowledgment

DiMAS wouldn't have been possible without the great work of all those people who created and maintain that wonderful programming language 'Rust' and its toolworld with and around 'Cargo'.
While 'Rust' is a programming language as powerful as 'C' but much safer, it is the ecosystem that makes the difference. Managing projects with 'Cargo' is a breeze compared to C's 'Make' or 'CMake'.

Many thanks go to the creators and maintainers of 'mdBook', the tool that drives this book. Writing tutorials and documentation with 'mdBook' is a pure pleasure.

On the technical side, a lot of inspiration came from my efforts to learn and work with ROS, the Robot Operating System, especially ROS2 and microROS for MicroController.

Last not least it is due to 'Zenoh', the communication protocol DiMAS is based on, that 'DiMAS finally saw the light of day. It was after listening to a presenation of 'Zenoh', that despite of several tries to create DiMAS with other programming languages, I made a last and successful attempt with 'Rust' and 'Zenoh'.
